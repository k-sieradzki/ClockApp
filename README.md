# ClockApp

The project was developed as an engineering thesis. Maybe I will rewrite it properly in React in the future.

In the project, I utilized HTML, SCSS, JavaScript, and the Fetch API. 
Users have access to a stopwatch, timer, alarm clock, and world time functionality through API integration. 
Alarms and cities are saved in localStorage.
